      # If using Ollama and it's running on your host machine,
      # you might need to configure the OLLAMA_BASE_URL for your Genkit flow.
      # For Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows), host.docker.internal usually works.
      # - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
      # For Linux, you might need to use the host's IP or network_mode: host.
      # This depends on how your genkitx-ollama plugin is configured to find Ollama.
      # The genkit.ts currently has Ollama plugin commented out.
      # If you re-enable it, ensure it can reach your Ollama instance.

    #   - ./app-data:/app/data # Example: persist data in ./app-data on the host
